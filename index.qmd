#### Diagonalizability

In this post I want to learn about 
Fourier transforms as coordinate changes. It
is also often said that the Fourier transform
diagonalizes operators, so that is
why I have titled this section accordingly. 

Let $A$ be a two by two real matrix. 
Suppose that there exist an orthonormal matrix
$U \in O(2)$ and a diagonal matrix $D = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb R^{2 \times 2},$
such that 
$A = UDU^T.$
**Then the $i$th column of $U$ is an eigenvector 
of $A$ with corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.**
Recall that a non-zero column vector $x = [x_1, x_2]^T \in \mathbb R^{2}$ 
is called an eigenvector of $A$ with corresponding 
eigenvalue $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ if 
$$Ax = \lambda x.$$
Here is how to see that $U_{\cdot, i}$ satisfies 
$A U_{\cdot, i} = \lambda_i U_{\cdot, i}$.
Let $i = 1$. 
We compute
\begin{align*}
(UDU^T)(U_{\cdot,1}) &= (UD) \begin{bmatrix}
                              1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} && \text{orthonormality}\\
                     &= U \begin{bmatrix}
                              \lambda_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
                     &= \lambda_1 U_{\cdot, 1}.
\end{align*}
A similar computation follows for $i = 2$.
In conclusion, when $A = UDU^T$ for an orthonormal matrix $U$ (used orthonormality in first step),
then the columns of $U$ are eigenvectors of $A$.

Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear operator 
on an abstract two dimensional 
vector space $V$ over the field $\mathbb R$. 
Let $v_1, v_2$ and $w_1, w_2$ be two bases of 
$V$.
Suppose 
$$ 
\text{Mat}_{v_1, v_2}^{w_1, w_2}(T) = A,
$$
which means that 
$T(v_1) = A_{1,1} w_1 + A_{2,1} w_2$
and 
$T(v_2) = A_{1,2} w_1 + A_{2,2} w_2$. 
In other words, the first column of $A$ 
holds the components of the abstract 
vector $T(v_1)$ in the basis $w_1,w_2$, 
and the second column of $A$ holds the 
components of the abstract vector $T(v_2)$ 
in the basis $w_1, w_2$. This could be written 
in the language of coordinate functions
for manifolds, but let me not go there. 
One more way to visualize $\text{Mat}_{v_1, v_2}^{w_1, w_2}(T) = A$
is via
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
(Tv_1)_{w_1,w_2} & (Tv_2)_{w_1,w_2}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

We say that 
the operator $T$ is diagonalizable if there exists
a basis $e_1, e_2$ of $V$ 
such that 
$e_1, e_2$ are eigenvectors of $T$: 
$Te_1 = \lambda_1 e_1$ and $T e_2 = \lambda_2 e_2$.
Then we see that 
$$
\text{Mat}_{e_1,e_2}^{e_1,e_2}(T) = \begin{bmatrix} 
(Te_1)_{e_1,e_2} & (Te_2)_{e_1, e_2} \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Suppose we know that $T$ is diagonalizable. 
Fix two bases 
$v_1, v_2$ and $w_1, w_2$ of $V$. 
Then the input space for the matrix 
$A = \text{Mat}_{v_1, v_2}^{w_1, w_2}(T)$
is the space of all possible
coordinates (i.e. $\mathbb R^2$) in the basis $v_1, v_2$.  
Meanwhile, the output space for the matrix $A$ 
is the space of all possible 
coordinates in the basis $w_1, w_2$. 

Then an equation of the form
$$
A = UDV,
$$
or more explicitly 
$$
\text{Mat}_{v_1, v_2}^{w_1, w_2}(T) = U \cdot \text{Mat}_{e_1,e_2}^{e_1,e_2}(T) \cdot V
$$
would suggest that 
$V$ is a change of basis matrix
from the basis $v_1, v_2$ to the basis $e_1, e_2$
and $U$ is a change of basis
matrix from the basis $e_1, e_2$ to the basis 
$w_1, w_2$. 

Let me review the idea of change of basis matrices. 
Suppose $U$ is a change of basis 
matrix from the basis $(e_1,e_2)$ to the basis 
$(w_1,w_2)$ of the abstract vector space $V$. 
Then we should be able to deduce how $U$ looks based on 
the one property it should satisfy, which is the following. 
$U$ should take the components of some abstract
vector $v \in V$ in the first basis $e_1, e_2$, and 
rewrite such coordinates with respect to the second basis
$w_1, w_2$. 
In particular, this should work for the special 
cases of $v = e_1$ and $v = e_2$. 

Suppose $e_1 = U_{11}w_1 + U_{21}w_2$ and that 
$e_2 = U_{12}w_1 + U_{22}w_2$ for some real numbers 
$U_{11}, U_{21}, U_{12}, U_{22},$ which are suggestively written. 
Then the desired property of a change of basis 
matrix says that 
$$
U (e_1)_{e_1,e_2} = U \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = (e_1)_{w_1,w_2} = \begin{bmatrix} U_{11} \\ U_{21} \end{bmatrix}
$$
and 
$$
U (e_2)_{e_1,e_2} = U \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = (e_2)_{w_1,w_2} = \begin{bmatrix} U_{12} \\ U_{22} \end{bmatrix}.
$$
This actually determines that 
$$ U = \begin{bmatrix} (e_1)_{w_1,w_2} & (e_2)_{w_1, w_2} \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} U_{11} & U_{12} \\ U_{21} & U_{22} \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Let that conclude my discussion on change of basis matrices, 
and let me now rewrite an earlier equation as
$$
\text{Mat}_{v_1, v_2}^{w_1, w_2}(T) = \begin{bmatrix} (e_1)_{w_1,w_2} & (e_2)_{w_1, w_2} \end{bmatrix} \cdot \text{Mat}_{e_1,e_2}^{e_1,e_2}(T) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} (v_1)_{e_1,e_2} & (v_2)_{e_1, e_2} \end{bmatrix}
$$
From here, we see that, if $T: V \to V$ is diagonalizable, meaning that there exists 
a basis of $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$, then 
any matrix of $T$ in arbitrary bases $v_1, v_2$ and $w_1, w_2$ will
also be diagonalizable 
in the sense of matrices. Why? Because change of basis
matrices always exist, and then we just 
multiply the diagonal matrix on either side accordingly 
to get equality with $A$.

Now let me approach things from a different perspective to 
learn about multiplication operators. I want to learn about
the folklore that the Fourier 
transform turns a differentiation operator
into a multiplication operator, and to see how
this connects to the discussion 
above of diagonalization. 

Consider the following watered down statement of the spectral theorem, 
based on the rigorous version found at the beginning of @BrenneckeCQFT. 
Let $T_A: V \to V$ be self-adjoint. Then there is a measure space
$\Omega$, a unitary map $U: V \to L^2(\Omega)$ 
and a real-valued measurable function $f: \Omega \to 
\mathbb R$ such that 
$$
(U T_A U^*) \phi = f \phi =: \mathcal{M}_f (\phi)
$$
for all $\phi \in L^2(\Omega)$. 
In other words, conjugation of $T_A$ by $U$ results in 
a multiplication operator, i.e., $\mathcal{M}_f$.

As a side note, I have used the notation $T_A$ 
because I want the matrix of $T_A$ in the canonical 
basis to be the matrix $A$, when $V = \mathbb R^n$. 

I can already say that the equation 
$(U T_A U^*) \phi = \mathcal{M}_f(\phi)$ reminds me of the equation
$UAU^T = D$, which comes from $A = U^TDU$, a variant of what I saw earlier, which would suggest that a diagonal matrix $D$ would
correspond to the multiplication operator $\mathcal{M}_f$ in some way. 
It also suggests that the unitary operator $U: V \to L^2(\Omega)$ corresponds
to a change of basis: the input basis could be the usual basis
of $V$ (if there is one), and the output basis would
be the canonical basis of the $L^2$ space given by the theorem, 
which (I hope) would be something 
like a basis of characters in the sense of Fourier analysis. 
But all of this is what I want to find out.

To move this discussion into the 
setting of diagonalization of finite dimensional operators, as I began 
with in this post, 
let me try to understand the following section from 
@BrenneckeCQFT: 

::: {.callout-note title="Quote"}
The Theorem generalizes the well-known fact from 
linear algebra that every Hermitian matrix $H = H^* \in \mathbb C^{n \times n}$
can be diagonalized and admits an orthonornal eigenbasis $(\phi_i)_{i=1}^n$ so that
$H(\phi_i) = \lambda_i \phi_i$ for suitable 
(real) eigenvalues $\lambda_i \in \mathbb R$. 
In this case, the spectral projection valued measure representation
of $H$ is simply given by
$$
H = \sum \lambda_i |\phi_i \rangle \langle \phi_i |.
$$
The map $U$ can be defined by linearly extending 
$\mathbb C^n \ni \phi_i \mapsto \chi_{\{ \lambda_i \}} \in L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{B}(\Omega), \mu)$, 
where $\Omega = \{\lambda_i: i = 1, \cdots, n \}$ and
where $\mu$ denotes the counting measure on $\Omega$.
:::

In the case of the quote, the map 
$$
f: \Omega = \{\lambda_i : i \in [n]\} \to \mathbb R
$$
in the spectral theorem 
is given by 
$$
f(x) = x, \text{ i.e., } f = id.
$$
Note also that 
when $\Omega = \{\lambda_i : i \in [n]\}$, 
it follows that 
$L^2(\Omega) = \mathbb C^{\Omega} = \mathbb C^n$, assuming the functions in $L^2$ are complex
valued. 

Let $T_H: V \to V$ be a linear operator from 
a complex vector space $V$ of dimension $n$, 
and let $H$ be the matrix of $T_H$ in the sense 
that 
$$
\text{Mat}_{\bf{e}_1, \cdots, \bf{e}_n}^{\bf{e}_1, \cdots, \bf{e}_n}(T_H) = H,
$$
where the boldface list $\bf{e}_1, \cdots, \bf{e}_n$ 
is the standard basis of $\mathbb C^n$.
And assume $H$ is Hermitian, as in the quote, with
eigenbasis $(\phi_i)_{i=1}^n$ and correponding eigenvalues 
$(\lambda_i)_{i=1}^n$. 
The statement of the spectral theorem, taking into account $f$ and $U$ from above, 
reads as follows: 
$$
(U T_H U^*) \phi = \mathcal{M}_{id} \phi \text{ pointwise on }\Omega
$$ {#eq-diag}
for all $\phi \in L^2(\Omega) = \mathbb C^n$.

Let me try to interpret @eq-diag
in terms of diagonal matrices. 
So $\phi$ in an assignment of a complex number
to each eigenvalue $\lambda_i$, for $i \in [n]$. 
Thus, 
$$
[\phi(\lambda_i), \cdots, \phi(\lambda_n)]^T \in \mathbb C^n.
$$
Next, 
$\mathcal{M}_{id} \phi$ is a function 
from $\Omega \to \mathbb C$. 
So there are $n = |\Omega|$ possible inputs, and the corresponding outputs, in vector form, are
$$
[(\mathcal{M}_{id}\phi)(\lambda_1), \cdots, (\mathcal{M}_{id}\phi)(\lambda_n) ]^T = [\lambda_1 \phi(\lambda_1), \cdots, \lambda_n \phi(\lambda_n) ]^T \in \mathbb C.
$$
Thus, 
$$
[(\mathcal{M}_{id}\phi)(\lambda_1), \cdots, (\mathcal{M}_{id}\phi)(\lambda_n) ]^T = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \cdots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix} [\phi(\lambda_i), \cdots, \phi(\lambda_n)]^T.
$$
This shows how 
the multiplication operator $\mathcal{M}_{id}$ corresponds to 
a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal.
In other words, @eq-diag corresponds to the equation
$UHU^* = D$ in matrix langauge, where $H$ may not be 
diaganal with respect to the standard basis $\bf{e}_1, \cdots, \bf{e}_n$. 
Continuing the change of basis analogy, 
it would be that 
$U^*$ is a change of basis from the basis 
$(\chi_{\{\lambda_i\}})_{i=1}^n$ of $L^2(\Omega)$
to the basis 
$\bf{e}_1, \cdots, \bf{e}_n$ of $\mathbb C^n$, 
and $U$ is a change of basis from the standard basis of 
$\mathbb C^n$ to the eigenvalue point functions. 

If diagonalizing the operator $T_H$ means conjugating
by a unitary map $U$, then I think via the above paragraphs, 
I have understood diagonalization. 
But I think it also instructive
to check that I actually chose the correct $f$ in the spectral theorem 
($f = id$) by verifying the eigenvalue equations in the following way.

Since $UT_HU^* = \mathcal{M}_{id}$,
it stands to reason that 
$T_H = U^* \mathcal{M}_{id} U$. Let's check this
on the eigenbasis, where we know the left hand side
will read: 
$$
T_H \phi_i = \lambda_i \phi_i.
$$
On the right hand side, fix $i=1$. We compute
\begin{align*}
(U^* \mathcal{M}_{id} U )(\phi_1) &= U^* (\mathcal{M}_{id}(U(\phi_1))) \\
&= U^*(id(\cdot) \chi_{\{\lambda_1\}}(\cdot) )\\
&= \lambda_1 \phi_1.
\end{align*}
The last equality is least clear, so let
me delve further into it. 
Note that $U(\lambda_1 \phi_1) = \lambda_1 U(\phi_1) = \lambda_1 \chi_{\{\lambda_1 \}}(\cdot) \in L^2(\Omega)$ by linearity.
But by definition of the indicator function 
$\chi_{\{\lambda_1 \}}(\cdot)$, it turns out that
$\lambda_i \mapsto \lambda_i \chi_{\{\lambda_1 \}}(\lambda_i)$, 
or equivalently, the function 
$id(\cdot) \chi_{\{\lambda_1\}}(\cdot) \in L^2(\Omega)$, is actually
equal to the function $\lambda_1 \chi_{\{\lambda_1 \}}(\cdot)$.
That is, 
$$
id(\cdot) \chi_{\{\lambda_1\}}(\cdot) = \lambda_1 \chi_{\{\lambda_1 \}}(\cdot).
$$
Thus, it makes sense to write
$U^*(id(\cdot) \chi_{\{\lambda_1\}}(\cdot)) = \lambda_1 \phi_1$. 
The upshot is that 
this then extends to when $i \ne 1$: 
$U^*(id(\cdot) \chi_{\{\lambda_i\}}(\cdot)) = \lambda_i \phi_i$. 
This confirms 
that 
$$
T_H \phi_i = (U^* \mathcal{M}_{id} U) \phi_i
$$
for all $i \in [n]$.
Then we get equality on all of $V$ by unique linear extension.

#### Fourier Transform as a diagonalizer

Let me sketch out what I'm thinking. 
There is some function space (or a dense subset of one),
call it $C^1(\mathbb R/\mathbb Z)$, 
on which the differentiation
operator $-i \frac{d}{dt}$ is self-adjoint. 
Also, if $e_n(x) = e^{-2\pi i n x}$ are characters, 
and the Fourier transform of $f \in C^1(\mathbb R/\mathbb Z)$ is 
given by 
$$
\mathcal{F}(f)(n) = \langle f, e_n \rangle_{L^2}
$$
such that $\mathcal{F}f : \mathbb Z \to \mathbb C$, or 
equivalently, $\mathcal{F}f \in \mathbb C^{\mathbb Z}$ is an 
absolutely summable sequence, then 
$$
(\mathcal{F} \circ -i\frac{d}{dt}) f (n) = -i \cdot i n (\mathcal{F}f)(n) = \mathcal{M}_{id}(n) (\mathcal{F}f)(n)
$$
for all integers $n$. 
If we let $A = -i \frac{d}{dt}$, then this is 
the statement that
$$
\mathcal{F} \circ A = \mathcal{M}_{id} \circ \mathcal{F},
$$
or that 
$$
\mathcal{F} \circ A \circ \mathcal{F}^* = \mathcal{M}_{id}.
$$
Thus, we see that the fourier transform 
diagonalizes the momentum operator $A$.
We can also see that the Fourier transform corresponds to 
the change of basis matrix $U$ from the beginning of the post, at
least positionally. In this case, I think the Fourier transform 
maps the basis $(e_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ of characters
to the standard basis of $\mathbb C^{\mathbb N}$ (elements
with 1 in the ith position, 0 everywhere else). Indeed, 
$$
(\mathcal{F}e_i)(n) = \langle e_i, e_n \rangle = \delta_{i}(n).
$$
The fact that the list of characters $(e_n(\cdot))$ is a basis 
of, for example, $L^2(\mathbb R/\mathbb Z)$, is the Fourier
theorem in Tao's Analysis 2 book @TaoAna2.

Let $x,y,v,w \in B_n$ such that 
$(x,y) \in E_n^1$ and $(v,w) \in E_n^1$, 
and so that these are distinct edges.
As in section 9 of @Chatterjee2016, 
for a configuration $U \in U(B_n)$ drawn from the product
Haar measure, 
define $V(x,y) = G_U(x)U(x,y)G_U(y)^*$
and $V(v,w) = G_U(v)U(v,w)G_U(w)^*$.

Let $a = |E_n^0|$ and let $r = |E_n^1|$. 
Let $\phi: \{1,\cdots, a\} \to E_n^0$ be a bijection
and let $\psi: \{1, \cdots, r\} \to E_n^1$
be a bijection as well. 

Thus, $V(x,y)$ is a random variable
from the probability space
$\left( \prod_{E_n} U(N), \mathcal{B}(\prod_{E_n} U(N)), du_{\phi(1)} \cdots du_{\phi(a)} du_{\psi(1)} \cdots du_{\psi(r)} \right)$ to the probability space $(U(N), \mathcal{B}(U(N)), \sigma)$, where $\sigma$ denotes Haar measure.
 
For the vertex $x$, let 
$$
i_1(x), \cdots, i_{|x|_1}(x)
$$
be the unique list of integers from the set
$\{1, \cdots, a\}$ such that 
$$
\phi(i_1(x)), \cdots, \phi(i_{|x|_1}(x))
$$
is the path of bonds in $E_n^0$ leading from vertex
$0 \in B_n$ to vertex $x \in B_n$.

Similary, define the lists
$$
i_1(y), \cdots, i_{|y|_1}(y)
$$
and 
$$
i_1(v), \cdots, i_{|v|_1}(v)
$$
and 
$$
i_1(w), \cdots, i_{|w|_1}(w).
$$
Recall the definition from the January 15, 2026 post: 
$G_n: U(B_n) \times B_n \to U(N)$ is given by 
$$
G_n(U,z) = \begin{cases}
I & \text{ if }z = 0 \\
u_{\phi(i_1(z))}\cdots u_{\phi(i_{|z|_1}(z))} & \text{ else},
\end{cases}
$$
where $\phi(i_1(z)), \cdots, \phi(i_{|z|_1}(z))$
is the unique path of bonds in $E_n^0$ 
between $0 \in B_n$ and $z \in B_n$.
By the Lemma from the January 15th post as well, we have the following: 
\begin{align*}
V(x,y) &= G_U(x)U(x,y)G_U(y)^* \\
&= G_n(U,x) U(x,y) G_n(U,y)^* \\
&= U_{\phi(i_1(x))} \cdots U_{\phi(i_{|x|_1}(x))} U(x,y) U_{\phi(i_{|y|_1}(y))}^* \cdots U_{\phi(i_{1}(y))}^*,
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
V(v, w) &= U_{\phi(i_1(v))} \cdots U_{\phi(i_{|v|_1}(v))} U(v,w) U_{\phi(i_{|w|_1}(w))}^* \cdots U_{\phi(i_{1}(w))}^*.
\end{align*}

I'll have to continue another day.


### January 15, 2026

Fix the box size $n \in \mathbb N$ and 
the dimension $d \in \mathbb N$.
Let $a = |E_n^0|$ and let $r = |E_n^1|$. 

Let $\phi_n: \{1, \cdots, a\} \to E_n^0$ be 
a bijection 
and let $\psi_n: \{1, \cdots, r\} \to E_n^1$
be a bijection as well, but 
let me suppress the $n$ from the notation, leaving
us with $\phi$ and $\psi$.

A configuration is an assignment 
$E_n \to U(N)$, or 
a sequence $(u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)} )$, 
where
$u_{\phi(l)} \in U(N)$ for all $l \in \{1, \cdots, a\}$
and $u_{\psi(l)} \in U(N)$ for all $l \in \{1, \cdots, r\}$.

Next we consider notation for axial gauge fixing. 
Recall that the set of all configurations on $(B_n, E_n)$ 
is denoted $U(B_n)$.
Let $G_n: U(B_n) \times B_n \to U(N)$ 
be defined by 
$$G_n((u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)}), x) = 
\begin{cases}
I & \text{if } x = 0 \\
u_{\phi(i_1(x))} \cdots u_{\phi(i_k(x))} & \text{if } x \ne 0.
\end{cases}
$$
where $k = |x|_1$ and 
$i_1(x), \cdots, i_k(x)$ is the unique sequence of integers taken from the set 
$\{1, \cdots, a\}$ such that 
$\phi(i_1(x)), \cdots, \phi(i_k(x))$ is the
path of bonds in $E_n^0$ leading from vertex $0 \in B_n$ to 
vertex $x \in B_n$.

::: {.callout-note title="Lemma"}
$G_n$ agrees with the definition of gauge fixing given in section 9 
of @Chatterjee2016.
:::

Proof. We have fixed the box size $n$. Next, fix a configuration $U \in U(B_n)$, or 
we may write $U = (u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)} )$
for some $u_{(\cdot)} \in U(N)$. 

We proceed by induction using the lexicographic ordering 
$\prec$ on the box lattice sites to show that 
$$G_U(x) = G_n(U,x)$$
 for all $x \in B_n$, where the
left hand side is Chatterjee's notation for axial 
gauge fixing.

The base case is $x = 0$. 
We indeed have
$G_U(0) = I = G_n(U,0)$. 

Now assume the induction hypothesis
that $G_U(y) = G_n((u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)}), y)$
for all $y \prec x$, for some $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_d) \in B_n$.

Let $j \in \{1, \cdots, d\}$ be the largest 
index such that $x_j \ne 0$. 
Let $y := x - e_j$.
Then $x \in B_n$ and $y \prec x$.
Hence, 
\begin{align*}
G_U(x) &= G_U(y)U(y,x) \\
&= G_n((u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)}), y) U(y,x) \\
&= u_{\phi(i_1(y))} \cdots u_{\phi(i_k(y))} U(y,x)
\end{align*}
where $k = |y|_1$ and 
$i_1(y), \cdots, i_k(y)$ is the unique sequence of integers taken from the set 
$\{1, \cdots, a\}$ such that 
$\phi(i_1(y)), \cdots, \phi(i_k(y))$ is the
path of bonds in $E_n^0$ leading from vertex $0 \in B_n$ to 
vertex $y \in B_n$. Observe that $(y,x) \in E_n^0$. 
Hence, the sequence $\phi(i_1(y)), \cdots, \phi(i_k(y)), (y,x)$
is a path from $0 \in B_n$ to $x \in B_n$ in the graph $(B_n, E_n^0)$. But
$(B_n, E_n^0)$ is a tree, so it is a unique path. 
Define $i_1(x) := i_1(y)$ and 
so forth until $i_k(x) := i_k(y)$. 
Then let $i_{k+1}(x)$ be the unique integer 
in the set $\{1, \cdots, a\} \setminus \{i_1(y), \cdots, i_k(y))\}$
such that $\phi(i_{k+1}(x)) = (y,x)$. Based on this, we conclude that
\begin{align*}
u_{\phi(i_1(y))} \cdots u_{\phi(i_k(y))} U(y,x) &= u_{\phi(i_1(x))} \cdots u_{\phi(i_k(x))} u_{\phi(i_{k+1}(x))} \\
&= G_n((u_{\phi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\phi(a)}, u_{\psi(1)}, \cdots, u_{\psi(r)}), x)
\end{align*}
which closes the induction. $\square$

Tomorrow, I want to use the notation 
$G_n$ and the notion of paths to 
rewrite my journal entry from January 13, 2026.

#### Literature Reflection (aka rabbit hole reflection)
I want to reflect in this post about
one rabbbit hole I went down. 

The story begins when I was looking
for notation to describe the tree that is
implicit in the $E_n^0$ edges of the box $B_n$, 
as described in @Chatterjee2016. 
So I visited first my old 
repository of pdfs from my Davidson times. In
that repository I looked 
at Bruce Sagan's "The Art of Counting," which
did not have what I needed in terms 
of describing a lattice tree, although 
I could use the definition of tree mentioned there. 
Then I visited Bonas's "A Walk through Combinatorics,"
which didn't have anything on lattices $\mathbb Z^d$, 
but had the definitions of graphs and such. 
Then I remembered the 
book Prof. Brennecke recommended, namely, 
"Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Systems" by Friedli and
Velenik. 
That book was written in 2019, and
I noticed a general difference between the 
notation in Chatterjee's 2016 paper
and the Lattice Systems book.
This got me a bit worried because 
it suggested that that notation I'm learning 
via the 2016 paper is outdated. 

Then the rabbit hole officially began because I 
was no longer looking for notation for the tree. 
I couldn't help myself and I looked up
Velenik's website because I was so impressed 
by the lattice systems book and I wondered 
if Velenik was already famous. Then, 
fueled by a lust for fame, I looked up 
Dominil-Copin, who also works at the same place 
as Velenik. I downloaded the article: 
"Marginal Triviality of the scaling limits ..."
by Copin and Aizenman. The one upshot of this 
is that I discovered what Prof. Brennecke meant 
when he said a Field's medal was awarded to 
proving the triviality of some 
quantum field model. 
Unable to stop my fame lust, 
I also looked up Chatterjee's website, and 
saw the Yang-Mills program he has concocted 
together with S. Cao. At this point
I was very burnt out and 
desperate to break the loop. 

Anyways, I think I'll continue to look
at some of the current articles for
ideas on notation, but hopefully I 
won't feel stuck in a loop like I did today.

#### Notation

I think it is better to make a list
of the possible notations for lattice gauge
theory. I'll allow myself
to write down multiple notations and see later
which ones stick. 

- Fix $\mathbb Z^d$ as the d-dimensional integer lattice.

- Let $e_1, \cdots, e_d$ be the standard basis
vectors in $\mathbb R^d$.
- Let $\mathfrak{E}$ (mathfrak E) be the underlying undirected edge set, which 
can be written
$$
\mathfrak{E} = \{\{i,j\} \subset \mathbb Z^d \mid |i-j|_1 = 1\}. 
$$
Note that $|i-j|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^d |i_k-j_k|$, where $i = (i_1, \cdots, i_d)$ and similarly for $j$. 
The metric $|\cdot|_1$ can be called the $l_1$ norm or the taxi-cab metric. 
Hence, $\mathfrak{E}$ is the set of 
nearest neighbor edges of the lattice $\mathbb Z^d$.

- Thus, $(\mathbb Z^d, \mathfrak{E})$ is a graph. 

- Let $\Lambda \subset \mathbb Z^d$. 

- Let
$$
\mathfrak{E}_{\Lambda} = \{\{i,j\} \subset \mathbb \Lambda \mid |i-j|_1 = 1\}
$$
be the nearest neighbor undirected edge set of the sublattice 
$\Lambda$. 

- Let 
$$
E'_{\Lambda} = \{(i,j) \in \Lambda^2 \mid |i-j|_1 = 1 \} 
$$
denote the 
positively and negatively oriented nearest neighbor edges and let 
$$
E_{\Lambda} = \{(i,j) \in \Lambda^2 \mid |i-j|_1 = 1, i < j \} 
$$
denote the positively oriented directed edge set of the lattice $\Lambda$, where 
$i < j$ denotes the lexicographic ordering on $\mathbb Z^d$. 

- Let $B_n = \{0, \cdots, n-1\}^d \subset \mathbb Z^d$

- Let 
\begin{align*}
E_n^0 = \{ (i,j) & \in B_n \times B_n \mid |i-j|_1 = 1, \text{ and for some } \\
                 & 1 \le k \le d \text{ and for some } i_1, \cdots, i_k: \\
                 & i = (i_1, \cdots, i_k, 0, \cdots, 0) \text{ and } j = i + e_k \}
\end{align*}

- Let $E_n$ be defined as in @Chatterjee2016 Section 2. Then $E_n = E_{B_n}$. 

- Let
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{E}_n^0 = \{ \{i,j\} & \subset B_n \mid |i-j|_1 = 1, \text{ and for some } \\
                 & 1 \le k \le d \text{ and for some } i_1, \cdots, i_k: \\
                 & i = (i_1, \cdots, i_k, 0, \cdots, 0) \text{ and } j = i + e_k \}
\end{align*}
be the undirected version of $E_n^0$. 

- The pair $(B_n, \mathfrak{E}_n^0)$ is a tree, or in other words, the underlying
undirected graph of $(B_n, E_n^0)$ is a tree. 

- A graph $(V,E)$ is a pair consisting of a vertex set $V$ and
an edge set $E \subset \{\{v_1,v_2\} \subset V \mid v_1 \ne v_2 \}$ 

- A finite sequence $v_1, \cdots, v_k$ of distinct vertices 
is called a path from $v_1$ to $v_k$ assuming 
$\{v_i, v_{i+1} \} \in E$ for all $i = 1, \cdots, k-1$. 
Similarly, 
to each path we can associate one and only one
list of edges
$v_1v_2, v_2v_3, \cdots, v_{k-1}v_k$, where
we have used the convention of writing an edge 
without the set bars. 

- We say that a graph is connected if for all $x,y \in V$, 
there is a path from $x$ to $y$

- Theorem (Sagan 1.10.2). Let $T$ be a graph with 
$|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$. The following are equivalent conditions
for $T$ to be a tree: 
  - $T$ is connected and acyclic
  - $T$ is acyclic and $n = m+1$
  - $T$ is connected and $n = m+1$
  - For every pair of vertices $u,v$, there is a unique path 
  from $u$ to $v$.

- Assume that $(B_n, \mathfrak{E}_n^0)$ is connected. One has
$|E_n^0| = n^d - 1$ as in section 17 of @Chatterjee2016. 
Thus, condition 3 of the theorem is satisfied, so it follows that 
$(B_n, \mathfrak{E}_n^0)$, or the underlying graph of $(B_n, E_n^0)$, is a tree.

- One can see that $(B_n, \mathfrak{E}_n^0)$ is connected in
the following way. Fix some vertex $x \in B_n$. We want 
to find a path to $y \in B_n$. First, 
find a path to $0$ in the following way. 
For each step, find the largest index $k$ which is non-zero, 
and subtract $e_k$ to obtain the next vertex. If the next vertex is
$y$, then stop. Else, continue to the 0 vertex. 
If $y$ is not reached before $0$, 
then proceed in the same way starting from 
$y$ and concatenate the paths. 


### January 13, 2026

I have written down on paper a ridiculous 
amount about Lemma 9.3 of @Chatterjee2016, so 
it's about time I start typing some of it.

#### One Argument from Lemma 9.3 of Chatterjee 2016

First let me cite one result about independent probabilistic objects,
which in shorthand says that
$X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables if 
$\mathbb E (f(X)g(Y)) = \mathbb E (f(X)) \mathbb E (g(Y))$
for a sufficiently robust family 
of functions $f, g$. I couldn't find this result in 
Klenke's book (although it's almost certainly implicit somewhere). I also
couldn't find it in Williams's Prob. With Martingales, though
looking at the Monotone class theorem looked 
related. I did find the result in Prof. Eberle's Bachelor's 
Probability theory notes: it is Satz 3.38. 

Recall the guage fixing procedure, 
which can be viewed abstractly as a map 
\begin{equation}
G_U': U(B_n) \to U_0(B_n),
\end{equation}
where I added the prime to
distinguish from $G_U(x)$, which
is an assigment to the vertex $x \in B_n$ 
of a unitary matrix.
I previously proved on paper that 
this map is onto, but let me skip a 
discussion of that. Given a configuration
$U \in U(B_n)$ and the gauge transform $G_U$ (determined by $U$), 
let $V(x,y) = G_U(x) U(x,y) G_U(y)^*$.

Lemma 9.3 says that the matrices
$\{V(x,y) \mid (x,y) \in E_n^1, U \in U(B_n)\}$ are independent
and Haar-distributed. 
Let me skip for now the discussion of 
these matrices being Haar-distributed. 

Let $i,j \in E_n^1$ be distinct edges.
Let $f, g \ge 0$ be measurable with respect to 
$(U(N), \mathcal{B}, \text{Haar})$.
A first step to Lemma 9.3 is 
proving that 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E [ f(V_i) g(V_j) ] = \mathbb E [ f(V_i) ] \mathbb E [ g(V_j) ]
\end{equation}
where the expectation is with regards
to product Haar measure on $U(B_n)$ because 
$V_i$ and $V_j$ are implicitly variables of 
the entire unitary configuration, not only the 
$E_n^1$ edge matrices. Explicity, 
we want to show that 
\begin{equation}
\int_{U(B_n)} f(V_i) g(V_j) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U_e) = \int_{U(B_n)} f(V_i) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma (U_e) \times \int_{U(B_n)} g(V_j) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma (U_e),
\end{equation}

where as in Chatterjee, we wrote $\text{Haar} = d\sigma$, for compactness of notation. 
By the definition of conditional expectation, 
we have that 


$$
\mathbb E [ f(V_i) g(V_j) ] = \mathbb E [ \mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ]] 
$${#eq-1}

Indeed, $Z(\omega) = \mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ] (\omega)$ 
is the almost surely unique random variable such that 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E[ 1_B( f(V_i) g(V_j) )] = \mathbb E[ 1_B( Z(\omega) )] 
\end{equation}
for all $B \in \sigma(U_0(B_n))$, the sigma algebra generated by
$U_0(B_n)$, viewed as a collection of random variables $(U_e)_{e \in E_n^0}$
on the product space $U(B_n)$.
Of course, $U(B_n) \in \sigma(U_0(B_n))$, so we get @eq-1.

Next, consider the following lemma from Prof. Eberle's notes:

::: {.callout-note title="Lemma (Eberle)"}
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$ be a probability space and let $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathcal{A}$ be a sub-sigma algebra.
Let $(S,\mathcal{S})$ and $(T, \mathcal{T})$ be measurable spaces. If $Y: \Omega \to S$ is $\mathcal{F}$ measurable and $X: \Omega \to T$ is independent of $\mathcal{F}$, and $\psi: S \times T \to [0,\infty)$ is a product measurable map, then 
$$
\mathbb E[\psi(X,Y) \mid \mathcal{F}](\omega) = \mathbb E[\psi(X,Y(\omega))]
$$
for almost all $\omega \in \Omega$.
:::
Note that on the right hand side in the formula in the lemma, $Y(\omega)$ is to be treated as a constant when you integrate to compute the expectation, whereas $X$ is still considered as a variable: 
$$
\mathbb E[\psi(X,Y(\omega))] = \int_\Omega \psi(X(\omega'), Y(\omega)) dP(\omega').
$$
In essense, you have fixed the variable $Y$ because you already know what it is, based on $\mathcal{F}$. 
In my setting, this is just
a rigorous way of writing that
the matrices attached to $E_n^0$ edges inside
the intergral can be treated as fixed. Let me 
demonstrate. 

Let $S := \prod_{E_n^0} U(N) = U_0(B_n)$ and $T := \prod_{E_n^1} U(N)$. 
Let also $\Omega = \prod_{E_n} U(N) = U(B_n)$. 
Let also 
$$
Y := Y(\omega) := Y(U_e)_{e \in E_n} = (U_e)_{e \in E_n^0}
$$
and 
$$
X := X(\omega) := X(U_e)_{e \in E_n} = (U_e)_{e \in E_n^1}.
$$
Note that $V_i$ can really be viewed as a function of 
the matrix variables on all edges $E_n$. We can write:
$$
V_i(U_e)_{e \in E_n} = U_0 \cdots U_0 U(i) U_0 \cdots U_0
$$
where $U_0$ is a placeholder for matrices attached to $E_n^0$ edges, and $U(i)$ is a matrix attached to edge $i \in E_n^1$. We can write in this way
because $G_U(x)$ is just a product of $U_0(B_n)$ matrices for any $x \in B_n$, and $G_U$ is deterministically a function of the variables $U_0(B_n)$. 

For ease of notation, let 
$$U_1 := (U_e)_{e \in E_n^1}$$
and 
$$U_0 := (U_e)_{e \in E_n^0} \in U_0(B_n).$$
Thus, we consider the definition 
\begin{align*}
\psi(X,Y) &= \psi(U_0,U_1)\\
&= f(U_0 U(i) U_0) g(U_0 U(j) U_0).
\end{align*}

Then by the Lemma, we have

\begin{align*}
\mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ](\omega) &= 
\mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ](U_e)_{e \in E_n} \\
&= \mathbb E[ f(V_i(U_e)_{e \in E_n^0}) g(V_j(U_e)_{e \in E_n^0}) ] \\
&= \int_{U(B_n)} f(U_0 U'(i) U_0) g(U_0 U'(j) U_0) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U'(e))
\end{align*}

Then by left and right invariance of
the Haar measure, we compute
\begin{align*}
\int_{U(B_n)} f(U_0 U'(i) U_0) g(U_0 U'(j) U_0) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U'(e)) &= \int_{U(B_n)} f(U'(i)) g(U'(j)) \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U'(e))
\end{align*}

Hence, 
$$
\mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ](\omega) = \mathbb E_{U'} [f(U'(i)) g(U'(j))].
$$

Then, 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E [ f(V_i) g(V_j) ] &= \mathbb E [ \mathbb E[ f(V_i) g(V_j) \mid U_0(B_n) ]] \\
&= \int_{U(B_n)} \mathbb E_{U'} [f(U'(i)) g(U'(j))] \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U_e)\\
&= \mathbb E_{U'} [f(U'(i)) g(U'(j))] \int_{U(B_n)} 1 \prod_{e \in E_n} d\sigma(U_e),
\end{align*}
where we pulled a "constant" out of the integral. Then by Haar invariance and Fubini
a couple times to split up $f$ and $g$, we conclude
the result 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E [ f(V_i) g(V_j) ] = \mathbb E [ f(V_i) ] \mathbb E [ g(V_j) ].
\end{equation}

I'm tired of this article for today, but one improvement would be to 
write out explicitly what the product $U_0 \cdots U_0$ actually is. 
In particular, I should first write down the tree
with root at the origin in the lattice. Then 
I should rewrite $i \in E_n^1$ as an 
edge of the form $(i_l, i_r)$, and then 
$G_U(i_l)$ will just be the product of 
$U_0$ matrices indexed by 
the edges from the origin $0$ to $i_l$ along the
tree. So if these tree edges 
are $t_0, \cdots, t_{i_l}$, then
the product would be 
$$
U_0 \cdots U_0 = U(t_0) \cdots U(t_{i_l}).
$$

### January 3, 2026

I'm studying section 12 in 
@Chatterjee2016, which is titled Some Standard Results About Gaussian 
Measures. I'd like to understand why
$Q$ being a positive definite $n$ by $n$ 
real matrix implies that 
$$x^TQx + v^Tx + C =: P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$$
for some positive constant $c$, 
for all $\Vert x \rVert$ sufficiently large, where 
$x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \mathbb R^n$. 
Maybe I should first mention what this is saying. 
When a real matrix $Q$ is positive definite, 
it means that the polynomial 
$$ \begin{matrix}
Q_{11} x_1^2 &+& \cdots &+& Q_{1n} x_1 x_n\\
\vdots && \ddots && \vdots \\
Q_{n1} x_1x_n &+& \cdots &+& Q_{nn} x_n^2
\end{matrix}$$
is strictly positive for all $x \ne 0$. So 
the matrix $Q$ is the coefficient matrix of the 
degree 2 monomials. Oh yeah, and $P(x)$ above is
just a general degree 2 polynomial in 
the real variables $x_1, \cdots, x_n$. 
I'll mention that the variables commute, so 
we can just assume that $Q$ is symmetric, 
because we can break up the coefficients 
into two equal halves. The main point of all this 
is that $P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$
is a necessary and sufficient criterion for
the integrability of a Gaussian density term
for a Gaussian measure (see section 12), 
so knowing that $Q$ being positive definite 
is equivalent allows you to later bring in 
stuff about smallest eigenvalues of $Q$, linear algebra
stuff, and other information that is not obvious 
from first glance. 

This implication of $Q$ positive definite implies
$P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$ is too hard for my 
little brain, so as a first step I need 
to consider an easier case: assume $v = 0$ and 
$C = 0$, so the polynomial $P$ is just 
made up of the terms in $x^TQx$. 
So I want to show that 
$$P(x) = x^T Qx \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$$
for some 
$c > 0$ and for all $\lVert x \rVert > r > 0$, 
where $r$ is some radius that is big enough. 

Let's assume that 
$$R_* := \inf_{\lVert x \rVert = 1} x^TQx > 0.$$
Hopefully I can prove later on that 
$Q$ being positive definite implies this infimum 
statement truly does hold, but I believe $Q$ being 
symmetric is also needed. 

If this infimum statement does truly hold, then 
since the infimum is a lower bound, 
then for any $\lVert x \rVert = 1$, we 
get the inequality
$$x^TQx \ge R_*$$
and since $\lVert x \rVert^2 = 1$, 
we also have 
$$x^TQx \ge R_* \lVert x \rVert^2.$$

Then take some arbitrary $x \in \mathbb R^n \setminus \overline{B}(0,1)$, that is, 
$\lVert x \rVert > 1.$
Scaling down $x$, we see that $\frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert}$ is 
on the sphere of radius 1. 
So it holds that 
$$\frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert}^T Q \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert} \ge R_* \lVert \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert} \rVert^2.$$
Then multiplying through by $\lVert x \rVert^2$, 
we see that 
$$x^T Q x \ge R_* \lVert x \rVert^2.$$
We have thus shown that 
with $c := R_*$ and 
$r = 1$, then for all
$\lVert x \rVert \ge r$, 
we have $P(x) = x^T Qx \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2,$
the desired conclusion.

Here are some other observations that
don't fit anywhere yet: 

#### Random Oberservations

Observation 1: $c\lVert x \rVert^2 = cx_1^2 + \cdots + cx_n^2.$

Observation 2: Consider the expression $x^TQx$ as being built of 
$$x^TQx = \text{diagonal}(Q,x) + \text{off-diagonal}(Q,x),$$
where 
$$\text{diagonal}(Q,x) = Q_{11}x_1^2 + \cdots + Q_{nn} x_n^2$$
and 
$$\text{off-diagonal}(Q,x) = \sum_{i \ne j} Q_{ij}x_ix_j.$$

Observation 3: I notice that the diagonal entries of $Q$ must be positive. 
Here's why. If $e_i = (0, \cdots, 1, \cdots, 0) \in \mathbb R^n$ is 
the vector with $0$ at every index besides the $i$th index, 
then 
$Q_{ii} = e_i^{T} Q e_i > 0$, 
by positive definiteness. 

#### Further Discussion

I wish I had time to graph some of the simpler 
cases. For instance, the case of $\mathbb R^n = \mathbb R^2$,
where we can name the variables $x$ and $y$, 
and then we can see the conic sections. 
Then the off diagonal part 
looks like
\begin{align*}
\text{off-diagonal}(Q,(x,y)) = Q_{12}xy + Q_{21}xy,
\end{align*}
which, when plotted as the graph of the 
function $z(x,y) = (Q_{12}+Q_{21})xy$ in $\mathbb R^3$, 
looks like a hyperbolic parabaloid. 
The diagonal part, being 
a quadratic form with positive coefficients, is always positive, 
and then 
$x^TQx> 0$ takes the geometric meaning
that the negaative part of the hyperbolic parabaloid
is dominated by the 
diagonal part.

#### Still Needed

Next I need to show that $Q$ being 
positive definite (and symmetric)
implies that $$R_* := \inf_{\lVert x \rVert = 1} x^TQx > 0.$$

Then I need to tackle the case where the linear part $v^Tx$ is 
non zero and the constant $C$ is also non-zero.
