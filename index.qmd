### January 3, 2026

I'm studying section 12 in 
@Chatterjee2016, which is titled Some Standard Results About Gaussian 
Measures. I'd like to understand why
$Q$ being a positive definite $n$ by $n$ 
real matrix implies that 
$$x^TQx + v^Tx + C =: P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$$
for some positive constant $c$, 
for all $\Vert x \rVert$ sufficiently large, where 
$x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \mathbb R^n$. 
Maybe I should first mention what this is saying. 
When a real matrix $Q$ is positive definite, 
it means that the polynomial 
$$ \begin{matrix}
Q_{11} x_1^2 &+& \cdots &+& Q_{1n} x_1 x_n\\
\vdots && \ddots && \vdots \\
Q_{n1} x_1x_n &+& \cdots &+& Q_{nn} x_n^2
\end{matrix}$$
is strictly positive for all $x \ne 0$. So 
the matrix $Q$ is the coefficient matrix of the 
degree 2 monomials. Oh yeah, and $P(x)$ above is
just a general degree 2 polynomial in 
the real variables $x_1, \cdots, x_n$. 
I'll mention that the variables commute, so 
we can just assume that $Q$ is symmetric, 
because we can break up the coefficients 
into two equal halves. The main point of all this 
is that $P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$
is a necessary and sufficient criterion for
the integrability of a Gaussian density term
for a Gaussian measure (see section 12), 
so knowing that $Q$ being positive definite 
is equivalent allows you to later bring in 
stuff about smallest eigenvalues of $Q$, linear algebra
stuff, and other information that is not obvious 
from first glance. 

This implication of $Q$ positive definite implies
$P(x) \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$ is too hard for my 
little brain, so as a first step I need 
to consider an easier case: assume $v = 0$ and 
$C = 0$, so the polynomial $P$ is just 
made up of the terms in $x^TQx$. 
So I want to show that 
$$P(x) = x^T Qx \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2$$
for some 
$c > 0$ and for all $\lVert x \rVert > r > 0$, 
where $r$ is some radius that is big enough. 

Let's assume that 
$$R_* := \inf_{\lVert x \rVert = 1} x^TQx > 0.$$
Hopefully I can prove later on that 
$Q$ being positive definite implies this infimum 
statement truly does hold, but I believe $Q$ being 
symmetric is also needed. 

If this infimum statement does truly hold, then 
since the infimum is a lower bound, 
then for any $\lVert x \rVert = 1$, we 
get the inequality
$$x^TQx \ge R_*$$
and since $\lVert x \rVert^2 = 1$, 
we also have 
$$x^TQx \ge R_* \lVert x \rVert^2.$$

Then take some arbitrary $x \in \mathbb R^n \setminus \overline{B}(0,1)$, that is, 
$\lVert x \rVert > 1.$
Scaling down $x$, we see that $\frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert}$ is 
on the sphere of radius 1. 
So it holds that 
$$\frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert}^T Q \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert} \ge R_* \lVert \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert} \rVert^2.$$
Then multiplying through by $\lVert x \rVert^2$, 
we see that 
$$x^T Q x \ge R_* \lVert x \rVert^2.$$
We have thus shown that 
with $c := R_*$ and 
$r = 1$, then for all
$\lVert x \rVert \ge r$, 
we have $P(x) = x^T Qx \ge c \lVert x \rVert^2,$
the desired conclusion.

Here are some other observations that
don't fit anywhere yet: 

#### Random Oberservations

Observation 1: $c\lVert x \rVert^2 = cx_1^2 + \cdots + cx_n^2.$

Observation 2: Consider the expression $x^TQx$ as being built of 
$$x^TQx = \text{diagonal}(Q,x) + \text{off-diagonal}(Q,x),$$
where 
$$\text{diagonal}(Q,x) = Q_{11}x_1^2 + \cdots + Q_{nn} x_n^2$$
and 
$$\text{off-diagonal}(Q,x) = \sum_{i \ne j} Q_{ij}x_ix_j.$$

Observation 3: I notice that the diagonal entries of $Q$ must be positive. 
Here's why. If $e_i = (0, \cdots, 1, \cdots, 0) \in \mathbb R^n$ is 
the vector with $0$ at every index besides the $i$th index, 
then 
$Q_{ii} = e_i^{T} Q e_i > 0$, 
by positive definiteness. 

#### Further Discussion

I wish I had time to graph some of the simpler 
cases. For instance, the case of $\mathbb R^n = \mathbb R^2$,
where we can name the variables $x$ and $y$, 
and then we can see the conic sections. 
Then the off diagonal part 
looks like
\begin{align*}
\text{off-diagonal}(Q,(x,y)) = Q_{12}xy + Q_{21}xy,
\end{align*}
which, when plotted as the graph of the 
function $z(x,y) = (Q_{12}+Q_{21})xy$ in $\mathbb R^3$, 
looks like a hyperbolic parabaloid. 
The diagonal part, being 
a quadratic form with positive coefficients, is always positive, 
and then 
$x^TQx> 0$ takes the geometric meaning
that the negaative part of the hyperbolic parabaloid
is dominated by the 
diagonal part.

#### Still Needed

Next I need to show that $Q$ being 
positive definite (and symmetric)
implies that $$R_* := \inf_{\lVert x \rVert = 1} x^TQx > 0.$$

Then I need to tackle the case where the linear part $v^Tx$ is 
non zero and the constant $C$ is also non-zero.
