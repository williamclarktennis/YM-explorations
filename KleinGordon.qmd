I'm writing this article so that I can learn Theorem 3.1 of 
Prof. Christian Brennecke's constructive quantum field theory
notes @BrenneckeCQFT. The statement of the theorem is as follows. 

::: {.callout-note title="Theorem 3.1"}
Consider the strongly continuous unitary representation $\Gamma(U)$ (gamma of U)
of $\mathcal{P}_{+}^{\uparrow}$ (P plus up) on 
$\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{F}_s(L^2(S_m^+))$ (Bosonic Fock space built over $L^2$
of the mass shell of mass $m$)
with Fock space vacuum $\Omega = (1,0,0,\cdots) \in \mathcal{H}$
and let $\phi = (\phi(f))_{f \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb R^4)}$
(family of operators indexed by 
Schwartz functions on $\mathbb R^4$)
be defined as (3.14):
\begin{equation}
\phi(f) = (2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p + (2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p^*.
\end{equation}
Then $(\mathcal{H}, \Gamma(U), \Omega, \phi)$ 
satisfies the Wightman axioms and 
\begin{equation}
(\square + m^2) \phi = 0
\end{equation}
in the sense of operator-valued distributions.
:::

#### The operator valued distribution (3.14)
Let me clarify (3.14) for myself.
Recall that the creation and annihilation
operators depend on some function $f \in L^2(\mathcal{M})$, 
where in this case $\mathcal{M} = S_m^+$.
Only once you have some $f$ can you talk about
an operator from the infinite tensor product 
space $\mathcal{F}_s$ to itself.
That is why I can write
\begin{equation}
a(\sqrt{ 2 \pi } \tilde{f} ) : \mathcal{F}_s \to \mathcal{F}_s,
\end{equation}
and this object is defined in section 2.4
in @BrenneckeCQFT.

Next, I want to phrase (3.14) directly 
in terms of rigorously defined objects. 
I'll use the identities
\begin{equation}
a(f) =: \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx \overline{f}(x) a_x
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
a^*(g) =: \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx g(x) a_x^*
\end{equation}
found in section 2.4 of Brennecke's notes. 
It follows that 
\begin{equation}
(2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p := a(\sqrt{2\pi} \overline{\tilde{f}}).
\end{equation}
This is nice because now I can just
refer back to section 2.4 to see how
$a(\sqrt{2\pi} \overline{\tilde{f}})$ acts 
on a tensor product on some dense subset in 
the Fock space.

In summary, (3.14) says
$$
\phi(f) = \sqrt{2 \pi } a(\overline{\tilde{f}}) + \sqrt{2 \pi } a^*( \tilde{f}).
$$

#### The unitary representation Gamma

Consider the phrase "strongly continuous unitary representation $\Gamma(U)$
of $\mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow$ on $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{F}_s(L^2(S_m^+))$."
We understand this phrase through the following discussion. 
Given an abstract group $G$ and a vector space $V$, a
unitary representation (of $G$ on $V$) is a homomorphism 
$\rho: G \to \mathcal{U}(V)$, where $\mathcal{U}(V)$ denotes the set 
of all unitary maps from $V$ to $V$, equipped
with composition as the multiplication operation (or matrix
multiplication). What is a natural topology to put 
on $\mathcal{U}(V)$? Perhaps an operator topology?

Equipping $G$ with a topology, we say that $\rho$ is strongly continuous
if for all $v \in V$
$$G \ni g \mapsto \rho(g)v \in V$$
is continuous. 
For example, if $G = SU(2)$ and $\iota : SU(2) \to U(2)$ is a strongly continuous
unitary representation of $SU(2)$ on $\mathbb C^2$, then
strong continuity means 
$$SU(2) \ni A \mapsto Av \in \mathbb C^2$$
is continuous
for all $v \in \mathbb C^2$. 

Thus, $\Gamma(U): \mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow \to \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F}_s(L^2(S_m^+)))$
should satisfy 
$$\mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow \ni (a,L) \mapsto \Gamma(U)((a,L))v \in \mathcal{F}_s(L^2(S_m^+))$$
is continuous, where $v$ is a fixed and arbitrary element 
of the Bosonic Fock space built over the mass
shell. Observe that $\Gamma(U)((a,L))$ is a unitary operator on Bosonic
Fock space, so it makes sense that applying it 
to $v$ gives a Bosonic function. 
Observe that $\Gamma(U)$ is not a finite dimensional 
representation because Fock space is 
not finite dimensional. 

It turns out that the unitary representation 
Gamma actually has a name: the second quantization 
of the unitary representation 
$U= (U(a,L))_{(a,L) \in \mathcal{P}_+^{\uparrow}}$. 
Thus, completely understanding $\Gamma(U)$ entails
understanding the representation $U$ of 
the proper Poincaré group $\mathcal{P}_+^{\uparrow}$ 
on $L^2$ of the mass shell $S_m^+$,
which can be seen in
definition (3.4) in the section 
on the quantization of a massive relativistic particle. 
To this end, let me look at the following exercise, which is 
Probem 3.1 (a) in @BrenneckeCQFT. 

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 1"}
For $(a,L) \in \mathcal{P}_+^{\uparrow}$, let $U(a,L)$ be defined as in (3.4): 
for $\psi \in L^2(S_m^+, \mathcal{B}(S_m^+), \lambda_m)$, we set
$$
(U(a,L)\psi)(p) = e^{ip^{\mu}a_{\mu}} \psi(L^{-1}p) 
$$
for almost every $p \in S_m^+$ and for all $(a,L) \in \mathcal{P}_+^{\uparrow}$.
Show that 
$\mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow \ni (a,L) \mapsto U(a,L) \in \mathcal{U}(L^2(S_m^+))$
defines a strongly continuous, unitary representation 
of $\mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow$ on $L^2(S_m^+) = L^2(S_m^+, \mathcal{B}(S_m^+), \lambda_m)$. 
:::

Proof. Step one is to
verify the homomorphism property
$$
U((a,L)(a'L'))\psi(p) = U(a,L)U(a',L')\psi(p)
$$ {#eq-1}
for all $(a,L), (a',L') \in \mathcal{P}_+^\uparrow$. 
By definition, 
$(a,L)(a',L') = (a+La', LL')$, so we make the appropriate substitution 
on the left hand side of @eq-1.

First I want to distill the formula (3.14), 
which is not exactly well-defined as written, 
but corresponds to something that is well-defined.
Thus, I will solve here an exercise in Brennecke's
notes that I expect will transfer to 
the situation of (3.14). The main theme will
be to interpret things in a distributional sense. 

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 1"}
Suppose that we define the free 
scalar field $(\phi(f))_{f \in S(\mathbb R^4)}$ of mass $m > 0$ 
by 
\begin{equation}
\phi(f) = \int_{\mathbb R} \frac{dt}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \big(a(e^{i\omega t} \sqrt{2 \omega}^{-1} \hat{f}(t,\cdot/(2\pi))) + a^*(e^{i\omega t} \sqrt{2 \omega}^{-1} \hat{f}(t,\cdot/(2\pi))) \big).
\end{equation}
Identifying heuristically $\phi(f) = \int_{\mathbb R^4} dx \phi_x f(x)$, 
show that this means that 
\begin{equation}
\phi_x = \int_{\mathbb R^3} \frac{dp}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \left( \frac{e^{-i(\omega(p)t - p\mathbf x)}}{\sqrt{2\omega(p)}} a_p + \frac{e^{i(\omega(p)t - p \mathbf{x})}}{\sqrt{2\omega(p)}}a_p^*  \right)
\end{equation}
for all $x = (t, \mathbf x) \in \mathbb R^4$.
:::

I will use the identities
\begin{equation}
a(f) = \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx \overline{f}(x) a_x
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
a^*(g) = \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx g(x) a_x^*
\end{equation}
found in section 2.4 of Brennecke's notes. 
They are motivated by the content of Chapter
3 in @Talagrand, which is at most 30 pages of 
reading. 


The conjugate in the right hand side of the first
identity comes from the fact that
the map from $f \maps to a(f)$ is anti-linear. 
Why would this imply the identity above? 
Recall that a map
which is anti-linear satisfies additivity
and conjugate homogenity: $\text{map}(\lambda v) = \overline{}
