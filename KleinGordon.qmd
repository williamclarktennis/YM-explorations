I'm writing this article so that I can learn Theorem 3.1 of 
Prof. Christian Brennecke's constructive quantum field theory
notes @BrenneckeCQFT. The statement of the theorem is as follows. 

::: {.callout-note title="Theorem 3.1"}
Consider the strongly continuous unitary representation $\Gamma(U)$ (gamma of U)
of $\mathcal{P}_{+}^{\uparrow}$ (P plus up) on 
$\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{F}_s(L^2(S_m^+))$ (Bosonic Fock space built over $L^2$
of the mass shell of mass $m$)
with Fock space vacuum $\Omega = (1,0,0,\cdots) \in \mathcal{H}$
and let $\phi = (\phi(f))_{f \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb R^4)}$
(family of operators indexed by 
Schwartz functions on $\mathbb R^4$)
be defined as (3.14):
\begin{equation}
\phi(f) = (2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p + (2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p^*.
\end{equation}
Then $(\mathcal{H}, \Gamma(U), \Omega, \phi)$ 
satisfies the Wightman axioms and 
\begin{equation}
(\square + m^2) \phi = 0
\end{equation}
in the sense of operator-valued distributions.
:::

Let me clarify (3.14) for myself.
Recall that the creation and annihilation
operators depend on some function $f \in L^2(\mathcal{M})$, 
where in this case $\mathcal{M} = S_m^+$.
Only once you have some $f$ can you talk about
an operator from the infinite tensor product 
space $\mathcal{F}_s$ to itself.
That is why I can write
\begin{equation}
a(\sqrt{ 2 \pi } \tilde{f} ) : \mathcal{F}_s \to \mathcal{F}_s,
\end{equation}
and this object is defined in section 2.4
in @BrenneckeCQFT.

Next, I want to phrase (3.14) directly 
in terms of rigorously defined objects. 
I'll use the identities
\begin{equation}
a(f) =: \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx \overline{f}(x) a_x
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
a^*(g) =: \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx g(x) a_x^*
\end{equation}
found in section 2.4 of Brennecke's notes. 
It follows that 
\begin{equation}
(2\pi)^{1/2} \int_{S_m^+} \lambda_m(dp) \tilde{f}(p) a_p := a(\sqrt{2\pi} \overline{\tilde{f}}).
\end{equation}
This is nice because now I can just
refer back to section 2.4 to see how
$a(\sqrt{2\pi} \overline{\tilde{f}})$ acts 
on a tensor product on some dense subset in 
the Fock space.


<!--
First I want to distill the formula (3.14), 
which is not exactly well-defined as written, 
but corresponds to something that is well-defined.
Thus, I will solve here an exercise in Brennecke's
notes that I expect will transfer to 
the situation of (3.14). The main theme will
be to interpret things in a distributional sense. 

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 1"}
Suppose that we define the free 
scalar field $(\phi(f))_{f \in S(\mathbb R^4)}$ of mass $m > 0$ 
by 
\begin{equation}
\phi(f) = \int_{\mathbb R} \frac{dt}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \big(a(e^{i\omega t} \sqrt{2 \omega}^{-1} \hat{f}(t,\cdot/(2\pi))) + a^*(e^{i\omega t} \sqrt{2 \omega}^{-1} \hat{f}(t,\cdot/(2\pi))) \big).
\end{equation}
Identifying heuristically $\phi(f) = \int_{\mathbb R^4} dx \phi_x f(x)$, 
show that this means that 
\begin{equation}
\phi_x = \int_{\mathbb R^3} \frac{dp}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \left( \frac{e^{-i(\omega(p)t - p\mathbf x)}}{\sqrt{2\omega(p)}} a_p + \frac{e^{i(\omega(p)t - p \mathbf{x})}}{\sqrt{2\omega(p)}}a_p^*  \right)
\end{equation}
for all $x = (t, \mathbf x) \in \mathbb R^4$.

I will use the identities
\begin{equation}
a(f) = \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx \overline{f}(x) a_x
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
a^*(g) = \int_{\mathbb R^d} dx g(x) a_x^*
\end{equation}
found in section 2.4 of Brennecke's notes. 
They are motivated by the content of Chapter
3 in @Talagrand, which is at most 30 pages of 
reading. 


The conjugate in the right hand side of the first
identity comes from the fact that
the map from $f \maps to a(f)$ is anti-linear. 
Why would this imply the identity above? 
Recall that a map
which is anti-linear satisfies additivity
and conjugate homogenity: $\text{map}(\lambda v) = \overline{}
