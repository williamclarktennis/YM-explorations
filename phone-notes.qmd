When the coupling constant 
of U(N) lattice gauge theory is
small, then beta is big. 
When beta is big, the format of the
Yang mills probability density 
forces the Wilson action
to be very small if there
is to be any probability mass
associated to a given configuration.
The Wilson action being small 
means that most unitary matrices
are equal to the identity matrix.
Matrices mostly being equal to
identity matrices implies
that parallel transporting
along plaquettes does not do
anything. So the gauge field has 
no effect. I think that the gauge
field having little effect 
and the coupling constant being
small are related concepts. 
By analogy, smallness of the coupling
constant for gravity means that 
gravity has little role. 

I was previously confused because
I noticed that when the coupling constant 
is large, then the Yang Mills gauge measure
is just a product Haar measure. 
I figured product Haar measure means
that there is no interaction, a contradiction
to the coupling constant being large. 
Perhaps the reason that this is
not a contradiction is that
unitary matrices under Haar measure
are not concentrated near the identity matrix,
so during parallel transport, the gauge 
field plays a bigger role. And the gauge field 
taking stronger role fits with 
the coupling constant being larger.

Conditional probabilities are where
you fix some prior knowledge/variables and 
then you ask about the probability 
for the remaining variables.

That seems like the right framework for
axial gauge fixing. You fix the variables
for the tree edges, then figure out
the rest of the variables.

The log beta term in the formula for the
free energy is related to 
the 1/beta smallness of the 
Wilson action.

Also, even though the math of cqft is
very eclectic and broad, it also
feels like a niche field. At least
I get that feeling when looking 
at one of the early papers by Fröhlich
and Brydges.
