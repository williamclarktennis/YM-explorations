Conditional probabilities are where
you fix some prior knowledge/variables and 
then you ask about the probability 
for the remaining variables.

That seems like the right framework for
axial gauge fixing. You fix the variables
for the tree edges, then figure out
the rest of the variables.

The log beta term in the formula for the
free energy is related to 
the 1/beta smallness of the 
Wilson action.

Also, even though the math of cqft is
very eclectic and broad, it also
feels like a niche field. At least
I get that feeling when looking 
at one of the early papers by Fröhlich
and Brydges.
