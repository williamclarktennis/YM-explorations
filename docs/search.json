    "text": "December 11, 2025\nToday I visited Glimm and Jaffe (1987). It is a technical work. It explains the program of constructive quantum field theory. One idea was the following: partial differential equations generalize ordinary differential equations and quantum field theories generalize partial differential equations. ODEs have one degree of freedom, usually time \\(t\\). PDEs usually have 3 or 4 degrees of freedom, say, \\(t, x, y,\\) and \\(z\\). But quantum fields have infinitely many degrees of freedom.\nODE -&gt; PDE -&gt; Quantum Fields\nRecall briefly that in a classical field, say, a vector field, one attaches a vector to each point in space. The prototypical example of a classical field is an electromagnetic field. In classical mechanics, one observes the trajectory of a particle, and its state is described by 6 degrees of freedom: 3 coordinates of position and 3 coordinates of momentum.\nSo, what are the degrees of freedom for a classical field? Note that each point in space should have a vector attached to it, say, a 3-vector. Wait, what is meant by degree of freedom for the case of a PDE depending on \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, p_1, p_2, p_3\\)? It should mean that, when values for these degrees of freedom are chosen, then all other observables are determined, so there is no more freedom left. In a classical field, then, we expect that the phase space again has something like 6 degrees of freedom. Once position and momentum are fixed, then all the vectors attached to any point in the phase space are determined.\nSo how could it be that a quantum field has infinitely many degrees of freedom? A quantum field is morally an operator attached to each point in space. I feel like there are still only finitely many degrees of freedom. Shouldn’t the operators be determined by whichever point in 4-space you are in?\n\n\nDecember 15, 2025\nToday I spent some time reading Chatterjee (2016). I feel like I have learned a little after spending time on other literature in the Communications of Mathematical Physics and Glimm and Jaffe (1987), but it felt very weak while reading Chatterjee (2016) again.\nI would like to understand the meaning of Chatterjee (2016)’s Theorem 2.1 statement and how it implies the results for the leading term of the free energy for \\(d = 3\\) and \\(d = 4\\), and also why one cannot conclude as much in the \\(d=4\\) case.\nI do see, vaguely, how Theorem 2.1 involves a renormalization (subtracting off \\(d\\) and \\(1/n\\) and so forth). I could see as well the results from section 8 and 9 on the a priori bounds, but they seemed not that impressive because the upper bound was quite huge.\n\n\nDecember 17, 2025\nToday I spent time reading Brennecke (2024) and Brennecke (2025). I’m not sure whether it is appropriate to cite lecture notes, but I mainly wanted to point out that I read Brennecke’s notes today.\nI’ve been mulling over representations. Let \\(G\\) be a group and let \\(V\\) be a vector space. A representation of \\(G\\) is a map \\(\\rho: G \\to GL(V)\\), where \\(GL(V)\\) is the set of invertible linear maps from the vector space \\(V\\) to itself. A finite dimensional representation is a representation where \\(V\\) is finite-dimensional.\nI’m confused about whether finite-dimensional representations arise in the context of the state transformation law for quantum fields. The state transformation law for a quantum field is a representation of the Poincaré group on the state space of the quantum system. In symbols: \\[\\begin{equation}\n(a,L) \\ni \\mathcal{P} \\to U(a,L) \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{H}).\n\\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\(U(a,L)\\) is a mapping from the infinite dimensional space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) to itself. So I don’t see how a finite dimensional representation could arise from the state transformation law.\nMy next guess as for where finite dimensional representations would arise in a quantum field theory is in the field transformation law. That is because one considers \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) matrices to describe the field transformation law. I need to recall field transformations in classical fields. Recall the notion of a vector field. And recall the transformation rules for derivations. I think the point is to describe the fields in different coordinate systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrennecke, Christian. 2024. “Mathematical Quantum Mechanics with Applications.” Lecture Notes. https://www.iam.uni-bonn.de/users/brennecke/home.\n\n\n———. 2025. “Introduction to Constructive Quantum Field Theory.” Lecture Notes. https://www.iam.uni-bonn.de/users/brennecke/home.\n\n\nChatterjee, Sourav. 2016. “The Leading Term of the Yang-Mills Free Energy.”\n\n\nGlimm, James, and Arthur Jaffe. 1987.
