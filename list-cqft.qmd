On this page, I will learn about the contents of
@BrenneckeCQFT via the method of lists. 

I apologize to Jaques Ellul for 
performing this technisized extraction of information.

Suppose $F \in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{P})$ and that $\{F,H\} = 0$. Then 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} F \circ (x(t), p(t)) = 0.
$$
:::
In this case, $F$ is called a conserved quantity under 
the Hamiltonian dynamics. 

:::{.callout-note title="Criterion to ensure vanishing of Poission Bracket with Hamiltonian"}
If $F \in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{P})$ is invariant 
under the Hamiltionian flow associated to 
the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$, meaning that 
$$
\Phi_{X_H}(t,\cdot)^*F = F,
$$
then 
$\{F,H\} = 0$.
:::

:::{.callout-note title="Hamiltionian vector field flows are coordinate transformations"}
Let $F \in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{P})$ be an observable (possibly the Hamiltonian). 
Then the flow, $\Phi_{X_H}(t, \cdot)$, of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H = \mathbf{J} \nabla H$
is equal to a canonical transformation $\phi \in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{P}, \mathbb R^{2n})$
for any time $t$.
:::

:::{.callout-note title="Symmetry of Hamiltionian implies observable is conserved"}
Let $F \in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{P})$. 
If the Hamilitionian $H$ is invariant under the flow generated by $X_F = \mathbf{J} \nabla F$, i.e., 
$$
H = \Phi_{X_F}(t, \cdot)^* H,
$$
then $\{F,H\} = 0$.
